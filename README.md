# Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic dataset with Python

Titanic movie is one of the most beautiful Love story movie I have ever seen. Love affair of Jack and Rose start in Ship and they enjoy the company of each other. Jack was a poor boy while Rose belong to a rich family and engaged to some other person Caledon. The ship drowns by bumping with a Iceberg.There were lifeboats for only 1178 people. Therefore 1500 people died out of 2224. This is not just a movie but a real story of Titanic ship that crashed in April, 1912.

We have data of all people of titanic who drowned or survived during mishap. I have explored this dataset and found a lot interesting facts about Titanic.

I have used Logistic Regression for my model fitting and prediction and I have used confusion matrix and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics to find out the accuracy which comes out to be 75.5%
